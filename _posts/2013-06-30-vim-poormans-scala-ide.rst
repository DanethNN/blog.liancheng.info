Several months ago, I enrolled Martin Odersky's `Functional Programming Principles in Scala`__ (a.k.a. ProgFun) on Coursera.  Ever since then, I became a big fan of this fantastic language.  When doing assignments of the ProgFun course, I was using the IDE recommended by the course, `the Scala IDE for Eclipse`__.  Actually I also tried NetBeans and IntelliJ IDEA, they are all greate IDE  It's greate, but recently, I am playing with `Spark`__.  With 3 VirtualBox VMs running a virtual Spark cluster, my old laptop suffers a lot, and just cannot offord the luxury of run any instance of Eclipse/NetBeans/IntelliJ IDEA.  That's why I finally resort to Vim.
